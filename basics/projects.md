## 1. Simple interest loan calculator  | Console app  
I (interest) = P (principal) x r (rate) x t (time periods).
Example:  
On a two-year loan of $20,000 with an annual interest rate of 8 percent, the simple interest is calculated as follows:  

20,000 x .08 x 2 = $3,200

Therefore, the total amount owed will be $23,200: $20,000 for the principal and $3,200 for interest.

2. Search by year  
3. Search by director    
4. Search by cast        
5. Search by duration        
6. Search by description  

Create a console application with parse args, see planets example
